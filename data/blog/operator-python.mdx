Operators are constructs that can manipulate the value of an operand.

For example operation 3 + 2 = 5. Here `3` and `2` are operands and `+` are operators.

Python programming language supports a variety of operators, including:

- [Arithmetic Operators](#arithmetic-operators)
- [Comparison (Relational)](#comparison-operators)
- [Assignment Operators](#assignment-operators)

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator              | Example                   | Explanation                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sum `+`               | `1 + 3 = 4`               | Adds the value of each operand or number                                                                                  |
| `-`                   | . subtraction `4 - 1 = 3` | Subtracts the value of the operand on the left using the operand on the right                                             |
| Multiplication `*`    | `2 * 4 = 8`               | Multiplying operands/numbers                                                                                              |
| Division `/`          | `10 / 5 = 2`              | To divide the operand on the left use the operand on the right                                                            |
| Remaining Divide `%`  | `11 % 2 = 1`              | Gets the remainder of the division of the operand to the left of the operator when divided by the operand to the right of |
| Rank `**`             | `8 ** 2 = 64`             | Raise the operand to the left of the operator by the operand to the right of the operator                                 |
| Integer Division `//` | `10 // 3 = 3`             | Same as division. It's just that the number after the comma is omitted                                                    |

Below is an example of using Arithmetic Operators in the Python programming language

```python:operator.py
  #ARITHMATIC OPERATOR

  #summing
  print(13 + 2)
  apple = 7
  orange = 9
  fruit = apple + orange #
  print(fruit)

  #Subtraction
  debt = 10000
  pay = 5000
  remainingDebt = debt - pay
  print("Your outstanding balance is ", remainingDebt)

  #Multiplication
  length = 15
  width = 8
  area = length * width
  print(area)

  #Distribution
  cake = 16
  child = 4
  cakePerChild = cake / child
  print("Each child will get as much cake as ", CakePerChild)

  #Remaining Divide / Modulus
  number1 = 14
  number2 = 5
  result = number1 % number2
  print("The remainder of the number ", number1, " and ", number2, " is ", result)

  #Rank
  number3 = 8
  number4 = 2
  resultPower = number3 ** number4
  print(resultPower)

  #Round Division
  print(10//3)
  #10 divided by 3 is 3.3333.  Because it is rounded it will produce a value of 3
```

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare a value for each operand.

| Operators                     | Example  | Explanation                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Equal to `==`                 | `1 == 1` | is True If each operand has the same value, then the condition is true or True.                                                     |
| Not equal to `!=`             | `2 != 2` | value False Will produce the opposite value of the actual condition.                                                                |
| Not equal to `<>`             | `2 <> 2` | value False Will produce the opposite value of the actual condition.                                                                |
| Greater than `>`              | `5 > 3`  | is True If the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, then the condition becomes true.           |
| Smaller than `<`              | `5 < 3`  | is True If the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, then the condition becomes true.              |
| Greater than or equal to `>=` | `5 >= 3` | is True If the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, or equal, then the condition becomes true. |
| Less than or equal to `<=`    | `5 <= 3` | is True If the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, or equal, then the condition becomes true.    |

### Assignment Operators

The assignment operator is used to assign or modify a value to a variable.

| Operators                     | Example   | Explanation                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Equal to `=`                  | `a = 1`   | Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.                                                                                       |
| Add equal to `+=`             | `a += 2`  | Returns the value of the variable with the value of the variable itself plus the value on the right.                                              |
| Less equal to `-=`            | `a -= 2`  | Assigns the value of the variable to the value of the variable itself minus the value on the right.                                               |
| Times equals `*=`             | `a *= 2`  | Returns the value of the variable by the value of the variable itself multiplied by the value on the right.                                       |
| Divide by `/=`                | `a /= 4`  | Returns the value of the variable by the value of the variable itself divided by the value on the right.                                          |
| The remainder equals `%=`     | `a %= 3`  | Returns the value of the variable by the value of the variable itself divided by the value on the right. What is taken later is the rest for him. |
| Power equals `**=`            | `a **= 3` | Assigns the value of the variable to the value of the variable itself to the power of the value on the right.                                     |
| Integer division equals `//=` | `a //= 3` | Divide the operator's left operand by the operator's right operand then the result is assigned to the left operand.                               |

### Priority Execution Operators in Python

Of all the operators above, each has a priority order which will be carried out first priority first, and so on until the last priority.

| Operators                         | Description |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `**`                              | Arithmetic  |
| `~, +, -`                         | Bitwise     |
| `*, /, %, //`                     | Arithmetic  |
| `+, -`                            | Arithmetic  |
| `>>, <<`                          | Bitwise     |
| `&`                               | Bitwise     |
| `^`                               | Bitwise     |
| `<=, <, >, >=`                    | Comparison  |
| `<> , ==, !=`                     | Comparison  |
| `=, %=, /=, //=, -=, +=, *=, **=` | Assignment  |
| `is, is not`                      | Identity    |
| `in, not in`                      | Membership  |
| `not, or, and`                    | Logic       |
