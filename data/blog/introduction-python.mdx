## Python understanding

Python is a programming language that is very easy, human friendly, and widely used. Until now, Python is still one of the top 3 most used programming languages. Both in the digital industry, education, and even in academia.

## Writing Python Files

### What are Python files?

A python file is a file with a `.py` extension that contains python scripts. We can execute the file through the python interpreter, either manually via the terminal, or using the IDE.

To create a `.py` file, we do not need a special application. Any application that we can use to type (text editor) then it can also be used to create a `.py` . file

## Creating Python Files

Let's just put it into practice.

Open your favorite text editor (here I use visual studio code)

Create a new file, then save it Introduction' you like, here I will give an example with the name `hello-world.py`.

In the file, write the following program code:

```python:hello-world.py
print("Hello World!")
```

## Execute Python Files

The next step after creating the python file is:

Execute it!

To execute, we can use several ways, the essence of which is the same.

Here we will try the most basic way, which is using the terminal.

Open your terminal / command prompt.

Navigate the terminal to the active folder where the python file we saved earlier.

Suppose we store the hello-world.py file in the /home/python/learning-python-basic directory, then we just need to navigate to that directory with the cd command.
After that, write the command `python <file-name.py>`

```sh
python hello-world.py
```

Type enter.

Then you will get output something like this:

```console
Hello World!
```
