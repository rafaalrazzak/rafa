A data type is a medium or memory on a computer that is used to store information.

Python itself has a data type that is quite unique when we compare it with other programming languages.

Here are the data types of the Python programming language:

| Data Type   | Examples                                | Explanations                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Boolean     | `TRUE` or `FALSE`                       | `TRUE` certifying that worth` 1`, or `FALSE` valuable one` 0`                            |
| String      | `" Come learn Python "`                 | Stating character / phrase can include letters numbers, etc. (flanked by the `" `or`' `) |
| Integer     | `25` or `1209`                          | Stated integer                                                                           |
| Float       | ` 3.14` or `0.99`                       | Stating number that has comma                                                            |
| Hexadecimal | ` 9a` or `1d3`                          | Stating numbers in hex format (based on the number 16)                                   |
| Complex     | ` 1 + 5j`                               | Stating couples real and imaginary numbers                                               |
| List        | `[ 'Xyz', 786, 2:23]`                   | Data strands that store various types of data and contents can be changed                |
| Tuple       | `( 'Xyz', 768, 2.23)`                   | Data strands that store various types of data but its contents can not be changed        |
| Dictionary  | `{ 'Name': 'Ilham Kurniawan', 'id': 2}` | Data strands that store various types of data such as bookmarks and value pairs          |

To try various data types, please try the Python script below.

```python:data-type.py
 #boolean datatype
 #There are 2 types of boolean data, namely true or false
 print(true)
 print(false)

 #String datatype
 #begins and ends with double quotes " " or single quote ' '
 print("Let's learn Python")
 print('Learn Python Very Easy')

 #Integer data type
 #integers
 print(20)

 #Float datatype
 #decimal number
 print(3.14)

 #Hexadecimal data type
 #hexadecinal numbers
 print(9a)

 #Complex data types
 #complex number
 print(5h)

 #List datatype
 # begins and ends with square brackets [ ]
 print([1,2,3,4,5])
 print(["one", "two", "three"])

 #Tuple datatype
 # begins and ends with parentheses ( )
 print((1,2,3,4,5))
 print(("one", "two", "three"))

 #Dictionary data types
 #begins and ends with curly braces { }
 print({"name":"Ilham", "age":20})

 #Dictionary data type is entered into the biodata variable
 biodata = {"name":"Kurniawan", "age": 21} #biography variable initialization process
 print(biodata) #printing process of biodata variable which contains data type Dictionary
 print(type(biodata)) # function to check the type of data type.  will show <class 'dict'> which means dict is a data type dictionary
```
