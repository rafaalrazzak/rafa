In general, statements in a programming language are executed sequentially. The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. But there will be situations where you have to write a lot of code, where there is a lot of code. If done manually then you will only waste energy by writing hundreds or even thousands of code. For that you need to use repetition in the Python programming language.

In the Python programming language, repetition is divided into 3 parts, namely:

- While Loop
- For Loop
- Nested Loop

### While Loop

While loop in Python, the statement is executed many times as long as the condition evaluates to true or `True`.

Below is an example of using the While Loop loop.

```python:while-loop.py
#Examples of using While Loop
#Note: Scoping in Python can use tabs instead of brackets

count = 0
while (count < 9):
 print("The count is: ", count)
 count = count + 1
 print("Goodbye!")
```

### For Loop

Python's `for` loop has the ability to iterate over items of any order, such as `list` or `string`.

Below is an example of using the For Loop loop.

```python:for-loop.py
#A simple for loop example
number = [1,2,3,4,5]
for x in numbers:
  print(x)

#Example of repetition for
fruit = ["pineapple", "apple", "orange"]
for food in fruit:
  print("I like to eat", food)
```

### Nested Loop

The Python programming language allows the use of one loop inside another loop. The following sections show some examples to illustrate the concept.
Below is an example of using Nested Loop.

```python:nested-loop.py
#Examples of using Nested Loop
#Note: Using modulo in conditionals assumes values ​​other than zero as True(true) and zero as False(false)
  i = 2
while(i < 100):
  j = 2
while(j <= (i/j)):
if not(i%j):
  break
j = j + 1
if (j > i/j):
 print(i, " is prime")
```
